#### Project Description
Platform Project is a web-based open source operating system platform developed for-developers by-developers for the purpose of combining and integrating multiple open source operating system platforms from one generic source to cater for all programming languages, allowing cross-platform interchangeability of source code to help developers to develop code that is artificially intelligent.

#### Problem Statement
Platforms in general either support a specific programming language, where there are several languages to choose from, the problem arises, how do we manage a platform with multiple projects or frameworks from one central source code.

#### Solution
Platform focuses on addressing this problem by making its source the only entry point into vast library of projects, frameworks, libraries and platforms. It aims at looking at  best practices, commonality and tries to implement an optimal solution that works for any scenario. 

Our goal is not to force a developer to do things in a certain way but to give the developer the option to choose any approach to development. Our focus is ensuring development project success at any scale or level.

By implementing this solution, a developer should not be limited to one approach to development but any approach that best suits the project's development cycle.
