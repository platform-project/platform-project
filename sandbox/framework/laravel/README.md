# Laravel Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to install the Laravel PHP framework on your local development environment. Laravel is a powerful and popular framework for building web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- PHP (recommended version 7.3 or higher)
- Composer (a PHP package manager)
- Node.js (for managing frontend assets)
- Git (for version control)

## Step 1: Install Composer

Composer is a PHP dependency manager and is used to install Laravel. You can download and install Composer from [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/).

## Step 2: Install Laravel

Once Composer is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a new Laravel project:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-laravel-app
```

Replace `my-laravel-app` with the desired name of your Laravel project directory. Composer will fetch Laravel and its dependencies and set up the project for you.

## Step 3: Configure Environment
Laravel uses environment variables for configuration. Create a .env file in the root of your project by copying the .env.example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit the .env file to set up your database connection, application name, and other configuration options as needed.

## Step 4: Generate an Application Key
Run the following command to generate a unique application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```
This key is used for encryption and should be kept secret.

## Step 5: Run the Development Server
To start a local development server, run the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```
This will start the server, and you can access your Laravel application at http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

## Step 6: Additional Setup (Optional)
Configure your web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to point to the public directory of your Laravel project if you're not using the built-in development server.
Set up your database and run migrations to create tables: `php artisan migrate`.
Install `npm` dependencies and compile assets: `npm install && npm run dev`.

## Step 7: Start Building
You're now ready to start building your Laravel application! Refer to the Laravel documentation for more information on how to develop with Laravel.

Happy coding!
