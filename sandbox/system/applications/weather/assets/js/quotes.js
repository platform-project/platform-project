        "When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace.",
        "I love a man with a great sense of humor and who is intelligent - a man who has a great smile. He has to make me laugh. I like a man who is very ambitious and driven and who has a good heart and makes me feel safe.

        "A birthday is just another day where you go to work and people give you love. Age is just a state of mind, and you are as old as you think you are. You have to count your blessings and be happy.",
        "We never know the love of a parent till we become parents ourselves.",
        "Becoming a father increases your capacity for love and your level of patience. It opens up another door in a person - a door which you may not even have known was there.

        "Where we love is home - home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts.",
        "Experts on romance say for a happy marriage there has to be more than a passionate love. For a lasting union, they insist, there must be a genuine liking for each other. Which, in my book, is a good definition for friendship.",

        "Love is the flower you've got to let grow.",
        "My friends and family are my support system. They tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear and they are there for me in the good and bad times. Without them I have no idea where I would be and I know that their love for me is what's keeping my head above the water.",

        "I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.",
        "Never forget the three powerful resources you always have available to you: love, prayer, and forgiveness.",
        "The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along.",

        "The course of true love never did run smooth.",
        "I love you, and because I love you, I would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies.",
        "Joy is prayer; joy is strength: joy is love; joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls.",

        "Study nature, love nature, stay close to nature. It will never fail you.",
        "Feelings aroused by the touch of someone's hand, the sound of music, the smell of a flower, a beautiful sunset, a work of art, love, laughter, hope and faith - all work on both the unconscious and the conscious aspects of the self, and they have physiological consequences as well.",
        "We are all born for love. It is the principle of existence, and its only end.",

        "I need to see my own beauty and to continue to be reminded that I am enough, that I am worthy of love without effort, that I am beautiful, that the texture of my hair and that the shape of my curves, the size of my lips, the color of my skin, and the feelings that I have are all worthy and okay.",
        "I thank God that I'm a product of my parents. That they infected me with their intelligence and energy for life, with their thirst for knowledge and their love. I'm grateful that I know where I come from.",

        "Prejudice is sinful. All blood flows red. And the most harmful and foolish kind of prejudice is prejudice against yourself. Every woman is your sister, and every woman needs her sisters. So try to give other women the courtesy of your compassion, respect, and forgiveness. Love yourself despite - and because of - your flaws.",

I love when clothes make cultural statements and I think personal style is really cool. I also freely recognize that fashion should be a hobby.",

        "If you don't love me, it does not matter, anyway I can love for both of us.",
        "Love is a really scary thing, and you never know what's going to happen. It's one of the most beautiful things in life, but it's one of the most terrifying. It's worth the fear because you have more knowledge, experience, you learn from people, and you have memories.",

        "Love is when he gives you a piece of your soul, that you never knew was missing.",
        "In the stillness of your presence, you can feel your own formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that animates your physical form. You can then feel the same life deep within every other human and every other creature. You look beyond the veil of form and separation. This is the realization of oneness. This is love.",

        "There's a big difference between falling in love with someone and falling in love with someone and getting married. Usually, after you get married, you fall in love with the person even more.",
        "Believe in yourself, listen to your gut, and do what you love.",
        "True love is selfless. It is prepared to sacrifice.",
        "The story of life is quicker than the blink of an eye, the story of love is hello, goodbye.",

        "We've got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant. You can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself. You've got to keep watering it. You've got to really look after it and nurture it.",

        "Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky.",
        "The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves, and not to twist them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them.",
        "What I am is how I came out. No one's perfect and you just have to accept your flaws and learn to love yourself.",
        "This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet.",
        "Pursue some path, however narrow and crooked, in which you can walk with love and reverence.",
        "I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together: black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American; young, old; gay, straight; men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance under the same proud flag to this big, bold country that we love.

        "​To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one's family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one's own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him.",

        "​Every day we have plenty of opportunities to get angry, stressed or offended. But what you're doing when you indulge these negative emotions is giving something outside yourself power over your happiness. You can choose to not let little things upset you.",
        "​The best way to pay for a lovely moment is to enjoy it.",
        "​Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city.",

        "​I do believe that if you haven't learnt about sadness, you cannot appreciate happiness.",
        "Christ the embodiment of love and purity, gave His life to us because of His love. This love is beautiful and eternal; and He gave it to us unconditionally!",
        "​Peace of mind comes with the ability to let go of your worries, suppress the ego and quiet the mind. Some experience it during meditation, relaxation, or through prayer. It is the absence of self when you allow things around you and within you to just be. Everyone has the ability to experience it, its our God-given gift, but many fail to find it because of all the chaos we allow into our lives. The average mind can generate over and above 55000 thoughts in a day. If you are able to relieve yourself off all those thought-processes in your mind, its very easy to experience it, even in the presence of chaos."
